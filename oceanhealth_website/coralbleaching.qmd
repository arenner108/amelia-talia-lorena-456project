### What is Coral Bleaching?  
Coral Bleaching is the act of corals losing their vibrant colors and turning white through being stressed. The leading cause of coral bleaching is climate change. This includes an increase in ocean temperature, overexposure to sunlight, or harmful nutrients from runoff or pollution. Any of these conditions could cause the coral to expel the symbiotic algae living in their tissues which in turn causes the corals to turn completely white - hence the bleaching term.

### Why is it important? 
It is important to remember that while corals are not necessarily "dead" from a coral bleaching event, it is still crucial to make sure they survive the bleaching events. Corals provide resources to many species that call the ocean their homes. By understanding the patterns in coral bleaching and bleaching severity, we can evaluate ocean health and understand what we can do to prevent more coral reefs from being bleached and ultimately prevent more damage to our oceans. 

### Data, Visualizations, and Results 

Data was obtained from Harvard Dataverse [(link to data)](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/file.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/KUVQKY/PAMLRZ&version=1.4) which is a free data repository that is open to all researchers from any discipline (both inside and outside of Harvard University). It allows researchers to share, archive, cite, and access different data-sets. It was published to the resporitory in 2016 but has data from the mid 1800s. 

Since this data-set is on corals, the ethical issues have to do with gathering information from marine life and and how much the data collection could cause harms. While the harms are minor, the benefits of this data being collected goes well beyond the health of the corals. This is because coral bleaching is an indicator of climate change so collecting data on the health of corals could have lasting impacts on reducing global warming.

The original severity code variable is on a scale of -1 to 3 with -1 meaning unknown, 0 meaning no bleaching, 1 meaning low severity, 2 meaning medium severity, and 3 meaning high severity. Overall, the graph suggests that over time there has a been a change in coral bleaching severity with minimal differences between the regions."}
